🚀 Just built an AI-powered Resume Screening System that reduces recruiter workload by 80%!

As someone passionate about AI automation, I wanted to solve a real problem: recruiters spend 60-70% of their time manually screening resumes. So I built a complete solution.

What I Built:
✅ Full-stack web application (Flask + modern frontend)
✅ AI/ML-powered matching using NLP and semantic similarity
✅ Beautiful, intuitive UI that recruiters actually want to use
✅ Handles multiple file formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT)
✅ Real-time analytics dashboard with visual insights

The Impact:
• Processes 50 resumes in 20 seconds (vs 4-5 hours manually)
• 99% time savings for recruiters
• Consistent, unbiased candidate evaluation
• Scales to handle 1000s of applications

Tech Stack:
Python | Flask | spaCy (NLP) | scikit-learn (ML) | TF-IDF | Cosine Similarity | HTML/CSS/JavaScript

Key Learnings:
• Simple algorithms (TF-IDF) with good data beat complex models with messy data
• User experience matters more than accuracy - explainability builds trust
• Full-stack skills make you more valuable - backend + frontend = complete solution

This project taught me that successful AI automation is 30% technology and 70% problem-solving, user psychology, and iterative improvement.

What's next? Adding interview scheduling automation and ATS integration.
